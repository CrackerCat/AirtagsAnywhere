## ‚ùì Why

With this project, you can see the airtags location on a simple web-app from any device.
The idea of this project is to learn how Airtags location are stored and how to use them, it has been made for educational purposes.

## üöÄ Quick start

### You'll need

- A bit of time
- Any device running MacOS that needs to be always on (to get airtags location and host the server)

### Getting Started On MacOS

- Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.dev/download)
- Clone the repository in a convenient location
- Replace "`localhost`" with the local ip address of your Mac in `front_airtags/src/config.json`
- run `npm install` in both back and front folder
- run `npm start` in back then front folder
- open `localhost:3000` on your browser and check if it's working

### Getting Started On Your Non-Apple Device

- Type the IP of your Mac on your address bar, followed by :3000, login, and that's it !


If you want to access it from the external network, do a wireguard server (or open the port 3000, but I do not recommend it)
